# Deep-Learning-Udacity
This repository contains all the portfolio projects completed during the Udacity's Nanodegree.

## Neural Networks
Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

#### [PROJECT- Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/Rizwanhcc/Deep-Learning-Udacity/tree/main/project-bikesharing)
Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.


## Convolutional Neural Networks
Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising.

#### [PROJECT- Dog-Breed Classifier](https://github.com/Rizwanhcc/Machine-Learning-Engineer/tree/main/Dog_breed_classification)
Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model—this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications.


## Recurrent Neural Networks
Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.

#### [PROJECT Generate TV scripts](https://github.com/Rizwanhcc/Deep-Learning-Udacity/tree/main/Generate-TV-Scripts)
Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.


## Generative Adversarial Networks
Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.

### [PROJECT - Generate Faces]()
Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!

## Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.

#### [PROJECT- Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/Rizwanhcc/Machine-Learning-Engineer/tree/main/Movie-Review-RNN-XGBoost)
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. You’ll build a model and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
